# Abstract 

    New York is a city with a huge diversity of people from all over the world and a wide variety of restaurants. This motivated us to think of what exactly makes a restaurant successful. In our project we are trying to explore these factors which influence the restaurantsâ€™ success using yelp data and urban data. In our approach, we first do clustering to find the clusters with similar types of restaurants. We further explore these restaurants along with NLP for customer reviews to analyze the customer satisfaction and we eventually find the factors which drives the success of restaurants in New York.
